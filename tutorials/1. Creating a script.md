***Creating your first script***

Note: To follow along with this tutorial, you need to have the appropriate application installed on your computer.  You also must be connected to the internet.

to create scripts, register on our platform: todo-url-goes-here

**Create the script** 

Go to your dashboard, and download your api-key file.  Place this in the data folder of your application.

If you are on windows, this is in the WindowsDesktopBuild_Data folder.

If you are on Mac OS, this is in the Contents folder.

Windows:

Go to your dashboard, and create a script.  Any scripts you create here will be visible in your app as long as you have the api-key.txt file in the correct location.  

To run one of your scripts on the Hololens, simply open the app on the Hololens, and look at the QR code on your dashboard, or the QR code on one of your script pages.  To scan another QR code or run another script, say "menu".  On Windows or Mac OS, press Control-M.

**Add the basics**

Copy and paste the following into the file:

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){

}

function update(time, player, left, right){

}
```

This is the basic shell of a script.  You'll notice there are three different things in here - setup, start and update.  

* setup 

This is where you put things that you want to happen before your script starts running at all.  This includes things like download images or models that you want to be available as soon as you run your script.

* start 

This is what happens as soon as your script starts running - after your things in setup have loaded.

* update 

This happens at every frame - every game step.  For example, if you tell an object to move a little bit inside of update, it will do    so at every gamestep, and move continuously.

You get a few different pieces of information in update: the current time, the position of the player, the left controller, and the right controller.  We'll go into more detail on these in later tutorials.  


**Testing**

Save this file, and open up the application.  When it's open, click once to open up the menu.  You should see a bunch of scripts available, like so:

If you move up to the first one (you can use the arrow keys), you should see that is your tutorial script.  Face the script and click, and it will run.
