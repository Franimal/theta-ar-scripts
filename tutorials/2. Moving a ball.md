In this tutorial we'll create a ball, change its colour, and make it move.

We'll be starting with the basic script shell again:

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){

}

function update(time, player, left, right){

}
```

**Creating a sphere**

To create the sphere, we can simply write this:

```sphere("a sphere");```

This will create a sphere where the user is standing, with the name "a sphere".

We'll want to be able to use the sphere later, so we need to keep a reference to it.  To do this we create a variable (var for short), and
tell it to store our ball.  We can call this whatever we want, but we'll call it 'ball'.

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){
  var ball = sphere("a sphere");
}

function update(time, player, left, right){

}
```

***Side note***

You can also load models from the script.  To do this, you need a .gltf mode file.  
- Go to a model page and press the download button
- Choose GLTF
- This will give you a zipped file - if you extract this file somewhere handy.
- Get the file path to the scene.gltf file inside.
- Add a download in your setup(), and then use createItem("model_name") in place of sphere("a sphere")

For example, if I download the files to "C:/Desktop/Model":

```javascript
function setup(){
	loadAssetFromUrl("C:/Desktop/Model/scene.gltf", "OurModel"); //Here we tell the script to load the model in
}

function start(){
  var ball = createItem("OurModel"); //Here we create the model, using the name that we gave the model in setup.
}

function update(time, player, left, right){

}
```


**Moving the sphere in front of us**

Creating a sphere on top of us isn't ideal, as we won't be able to see it.  To move it in front of us, we need to do the following:

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){
  var ball = sphere("a sphere");
  wrap(ball).move(0, 0, 2);
}

function update(time, player, left, right){

}
```

There are a few things to talk about here.  First, you'll notice we have wrapped the ball with ```wrap(ball)```.  This attaches a controller
to our ball that allows us to do things like move it and change its color, within the script.  

Here, we have moved it forward 2 meters.  There are three numbers that we give to move, and they are the x, y and z directions - left to right, 
down to up, and back to front; ```move(0, 0, 2)``` will move it 0 meters across and up, and 2 meters in front.

Here is a list of some of the things we can do to our wrapper ball:
```javascript
.move(x, y, z)                      Moves the object along the x, y and z axes
.rotate(x, y, z)                    Rotates the object around the x, y and z axes
.scale(x, y, z)                     Scales/resizes the object in the x, y and z directions
.color(red, green, blue, alpha)     Changes the colour of the object to the specified red, green, blue and alpha values - values are from 0 to 1 
.emit(red, green, blue, alpha)      Changes the emission/glow colour of the object to the specified red, green, blue and alpha values - values are from 0 to 1
.texture(imageUrl)                  Changes the textures of the object to the image from the URL
.parent(object)                     Sets the parent of the object to the given object.  This means that if the parent moves, rotates or scales the child wil also move, rotate or scale.
.moveInDirection(x, y, z, speed)    Tells the object to move in the given direction at the given speed.
```

Now we want to change the balls colour.  To do this, we need to add ```.color(r, g, b, a)``` to our list of intsructions.  We could give whatever colour we want to our ball: we could do red ```.color(1, 0, 0, 1)```, we could do green: ```.color(0, 1, 0, 1)```, or we could make it blue and half transparent: ```.color(0, 0, 1, 0.5)```.  

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){
  var ball = sphere("a sphere");
  wrap(ball)
    .move(0, 0, 2)
    .color(0, 1, 1, 0.5); //We need a semicolon (;) at the end of this line, to tell the application that there are no more instructions.
}

function update(time, player, left, right){

}
```

If you run the script, you should see a coloured ball in front of you.

Now, we'll make it move.

We can use the instruction ```moveInDirection(x, y, z, speed)```.  If we want it to move away from us, we can tell it to move 0 
units along the x axis each time, 0 units along the y axis, and 1 unit along the z axis.  We could give it any speed, so we'll give it 1.

Here, our coloured ball will appear in front of us and then move away:

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){
  var ball = sphere("a sphere");
  wrap(ball)
    .move(0, 0, 2)
    .color(0, 1, 1, 0.5)
    .moveInDirection(0, 0, 1, 1);
}

function update(time, player, left, right){

}
```
