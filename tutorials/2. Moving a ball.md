In this tutorial we'll create a ball, change its color, and make it move.

We'll be starting with the basic script shell again:

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){

}

function update(){

}
```

**Creating a sphere**

To create the sphere, we can simply write this:

```sphere("a sphere");```

This will create a sphere where the user is standing, with the name "a sphere".

We'll want to be able to use the sphere later, so we need to keep a reference to it.  To do this we create a variable (var for short), and
tell it to store our ball.  We can call this whatever we want, but we'll call it 'ball'.

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){
  var ball = sphere("a sphere");
}

function update(){

}
```

**Moving the sphere in front of us**

Creating a sphere on top of us isn't ideal, as we won't be able to see it.  To move it in front of us, we need to do the following:

```javascript
function setup(){

}

function start(){
  var ball = sphere("a sphere");
  wrap(ball).move(0, 0, 2);
}

function update(){

}
```

There are a few things to talk about here.  First, you'll notice we have wrapped the ball with ```wrap(ball)``.  This attaches a controller
to our ball that allows us to do things like move it and change its color.  

Here, we have moved it forward 2 meters.  There are three numbers that we give to move, and they are the x, y and z directions - left to right, 
down to up, and back to front, ```move(0, 0, 2)```, so we have moved it 0 meters across and up, and 2 meters in front.

Here is a list of some of the things we can to do our wrapper ball:
```javascript
.move(x, y, z)                      Moves the object along the x, y and z axes
.rotate(x, y, z)                    Rotates the object around the x, y and z axes
.scale(x, y, z)                     Scales/resizes the object in the x, y and z directions
.color(red, green, blue, alpha)     Changes the color of the object to the specified red, green, blue and alpha values - values are from 0 to 1 
.emit(red, green, blue, alpha)      Changes the emission/glow color of the object to the specified red, green, blue and alpha values - values are from 0 to 1
.texture(imageUrl)                  Changes the textures of the object to the image from the URL
.parent(object)                     Sets the parent of the object to the given object.  This means that if the parent moves, rotates or scales the child wil also move, rotate or scale.
```
