***Custom Instructions***

The game object wrapper comes with a bunch of useful instructions that you can use.  Some of the current ones are:

'''destroyOnHit(key, objectToHit)'''
'''playerDistanceTrigger(key, doDistance, action)'''
'''fadeWhenClose(key, distanceOpaque, distanceInvisible, onComplete)'''
'''orbitHorizontal(key, radius, totalTime, onComplete)'''
'''orbitVertical(key, radius, totalTime, onComplete)'''
'''transitionPos(key, x, y, z, totalTime, onComplete)'''
'''transitionScale(key, x, y, z, totalTime, onComplete)'''
'''transitionRot(key, x, y, z, totalTime, onComplete)'''
'''bindLeftTouchpad(obj)'''
'''bindRightTouchpad(obj)'''

You aren't stuck with these, though - if you feel like tinkering, you can make instructions that do whatever you want.

***Technical***

Instructions are functions that take certain set of properties.  They always match this signature:

'''function(instructionComponent, collided, inGaze, time, player, left, right)'''

***instructionComponent*** is the wrapped object - remember when we did wrap(ball)?  wrapping the object gives us the instructionComponent, which 
enables all of these instructions.  

***collided*** is the object that this wrapped object collided with recently, if any exists.

***inGaze*** tells us whether or not the player is currently looking at the object, or pointing at it with a controller.

***time*** tells us the current game time, in seconds.

***player*** gives us information about the users location, rotation, scale etc.

***left*** gives us information about the left controller, if one exists.

***right*** gives us information about the right controller, if one exists.

Lets take a look at the instruction that binds the left touchpad of a motion controller.

```javascript
function bindLeftTouchpad(obj){
	return function(instructionComponent, collided, inGaze, time, player, left, right){	
		setPosition(obj.gameObject, left.touchpadTransform.gameObject);
	}
}
```

To add this instruction to an object, you would do this:

```javascript
wrap(obj).instruction(bindLeftTouchpad(objectToAttachToTouchpad));
```

By passing in bindLeftTouchpad as an instruction to the object, you are telling the object to run this:

```javascript
function(instructionComponent, collided, inGaze, time, player, left, right){	
		setPosition(obj.gameObject, left.touchpadTransform.gameObject);
}
```

When ran, this will set the position of the object you want to attach to the controller to the controllers position ***on every game step.***

Let's say you want to add a simple instruction that moves the object a certain amount every game step.  You can do something like this:

```javascript
start(){
	var ball = sphere("our ball");
	
	wrap(ball).instruction(
		function(instructionComponent, collided, inGaze, time, player, left, right){
			instructionComponent.move(0, 0.1, 0);
		}
	);
}
```javascript

Here, we are creating the instruction function directly inside the place that we are putting the instruction into the object.  At every game step, the ball will 
move along the y-axis 0.1 of a meter.

Our full script with a custom instruction:

```javascript
setup(){

}

start(){
	var ball = sphere("our ball");
	
	wrap(ball).instruction(
		function(instructionComponent, collided, inGaze, time, player, left, right){
			instructionComponent.move(0, 0.1, 0);
		}
	);
}

update(time, player, left, right){

}
```

Custom instructions are very flexible, and can be as simple or complicated as you like.  As an example, here is the orbit instruction - it makes an object move around
it's starting point in a circle.

```javascript
function orbit(key, vertical, radius, totalTime, onComplete){
	var startTime = 0;
	var pauseTime = 0;
	var startPause = 0;
	
	var localPauseTime = 0;
	
	var gazing = false;
	
	var started = false;
	
	var center = newVector(0, 0, 0);
	
	return function(instructionComponent, collided, inGaze, time, player, left, right){
		if(!started){
			center = newVector(instructionComponent.position.x, instructionComponent.position.y, instructionComponent.position.z);
			started = true;
		}
		
		var t = ((time - pauseTime) - startTime) / totalTime;
		
		if((time - pauseTime) - startTime >= totalTime){
			startTime = (time - pauseTime);
		}
	
		var radians = t * 3.1415926535 * 2;
		if(vertical){
			var x = center.x + radius * Math.cos(radians);
			var y = center.y + radius * Math.sin(radians);
			var z = center.z;
		} else {
			var x = center.x + radius * Math.cos(radians);
			var y = center.y;
			var z = center.z + radius * Math.sin(radians);
		}
		
		setPosition(instructionComponent.gameObject, newVector(x, y, z));					
	}
}
```
